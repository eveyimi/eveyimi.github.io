I" <p>Hello, welcome to my blog! This post will explore COVID-19 related clinical trials. If you are interested, please visit my <strong><a href="https://github.com/eveyimi/eveyimi.github.io">GitHub</a></strong> for more information.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>The following are ongoing and completed COVID-19 studies listed on the World Health Organization‚Äôs International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). Information in the WHO ICTRP comes from clinical trial databases maintained by other countries or regions of the world. COVID-19 studies listed on ClinicalTrials.gov are not included in the list below, but can be found using our search for COVID-19.
To give researchers and the public rapid access to studies on COVID-19 in other countries, ClinicalTrials.gov will update this list weekly. You can also access the information directly from the WHO ICTRP.</p>

<p>We developed a dashboard to display the information related to COVID-19 related clinical trials, including data visualization of world trials and U.S. trials, clustering tirals by similarity and predicting trials‚Äô opening status. Our audience of visualization parts could be any people who are curious about COVID-19 related clinical trials even without professional knowledge since all plots are intuitive and easy to understand. But for the clustering part and predicting part, our audience needs to have some knowledge of statistics. We all know that clinical research is a crucial step to overcome the virus. The purpose of our project is to give people a basic understanding of COVID-19 related clinical research and to increase confidence for everyone to defeat the virus.</p>

<p>My main contribution:</p>

<p>You can find all code in our repository.</p>

<h1 id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</h1>
<p>Based on my teammates‚Äô basic data cleaning process, I further cleaned the data to make it comply with SQLite3 schema.</p>

<h3 id="1-get-data">1. Get data</h3>
<p>The first step I did was to get the data and take a deep look of the data. Basically, my teammates did the following steps.</p>
<ul>
  <li>selected columns of interests</li>
  <li>cleaned date columns into standard format with month and year</li>
  <li>cleaned locations columns, including country, city of state, instituions</li>
  <li>transferred all letters to upper cases</li>
  <li>replaced ‚Äúnan‚Äù and ‚ÄúNaN‚Äù to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">np.nan</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Based on their effort, I found that there are still fields cleaning steps could be optimized and thus further cleaned the data to make them efficient and easy to use.</p>

<h3 id="2-clean-study-design-and-intervention">2. Clean Study Design and Intervention</h3>
<p>First, I found that there are two fields are JSON-like, which is defined by myself. Strictly speaking, they are not JSON data, but they looked like JSON data. In each cell of them, several pairs of key and value exist, which are mapped by colon and separated by vertical bars. I wrote two funtions which were applied to each row of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Study Design</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intervention</code> to get the pair of key and value, save the data into real JSON format and then transfer the JSON data into dataframe. Below are examples of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Study Design</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intervention</code>. We can see that there are ALLOCATION, INTERVENTION MODEL, MASKING and PRIMARY PURPOSE keys inside this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Study Design</code> cell. There are also DRUG and PROCEDURE keys inside this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intervention</code> cell.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>    # Study Design
    'ALLOCATION: RANDOMIZED|INTERVENTION MODEL: SINGLE GROUP ASSIGNMENT|MASKING: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|PRIMARY PURPOSE: TREATMENT'
    # Intervention
    'DRUG: DUVELISIB|PROCEDURE: PERIPHERAL BLOOD DRAW
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Actually, there are more keys inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Study Design</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Intervention</code>, which is a difficulty here to not miss any of them. My strategy is to first extract all possibles keys and then for each cell find out if any key exists. Eventually, I successfully expand those them and get dataframes. Below is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Study Design</code> dataframe. We can find that it is super sparse.</p>

<h3 id="3-create-a-sqlite3-schema-following-3nf">3. Create a SQLite3 schema following 3NF</h3>
<p>As introduced in previous post of spotify data normalization, third normal form (3NF) is a database schema design approach for relational databases which uses normalizing principles to reduce the duplication of data, avoid data anomalies, ensure referential integrity, and simplify data management. Therefore, to make our data easy to manipulate, I created a SQLite3 schema following 3NF.</p>

<h1 id="openning-status-classification">Openning Status classification</h1>
<p>In the beginning, I plan to predict if the clinical trial will succeed or not based on variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code>. I thought it would be really meaningful to have an idea of this most important sense. But when I looked into the data, I found that the data is highly imbalanced‚Äìit indicates that only one trial is successful, whose status is ‚ÄòAPPROVED FOR MARKETING‚Äô.</p>
